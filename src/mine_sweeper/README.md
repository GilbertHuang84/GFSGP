# Summary

There was a python challenge which Alok send me in 19, July.

It needs to create a simple mine sweeper in python in 15 hours.

I finished the main logic and a very simple UI in 4.5 hours.

Making the UI better actually needs unlimited time, so I give up.

Just posting the code of rough version here.

# How to use it

*python main_window.py*
